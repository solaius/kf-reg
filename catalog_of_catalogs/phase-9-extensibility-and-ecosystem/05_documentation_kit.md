# 05 Documentation kit

## Objective

Make it easy for a new team to build and publish a plugin correctly.

The kit must be generated by catalog-gen vNext and kept consistent.

## Required docs (generated stubs, editable)

1. `README.md`
   - what the plugin is
   - supported entity types
   - how to run locally
   - how to add sources

2. `docs/provider-guide.md`
   - YAML provider configuration
   - HTTP provider configuration
   - Git provider configuration
   - OCI provider configuration (if applicable)
   - examples of sources.yaml sections

3. `docs/schema-guide.md`
   - catalog.yaml schema mapping to API fields
   - filterQuery supported fields
   - UI hints overview

4. `docs/testing.md`
   - unit tests
   - conformance tests
   - e2e harness instructions

5. `docs/publishing.md`
   - versioning rules
   - publishing module releases
   - producing a plugin-enabled catalog-server image using the server builder
   - how to submit to “supported plugin index” (governance)

## Definition of Done

- catalog-gen vNext generates the documentation kit for new plugins
- docs include copy/paste working examples
- docs are validated in CI for broken links and missing required sections

## Acceptance Criteria

- A different team can follow the docs end-to-end to publish a working plugin

## Verification plan

- “docs-only usability test”:
  - a new dev follows docs to build and run the plugin
  - capture friction points and update templates
